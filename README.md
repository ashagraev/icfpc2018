==========================================

Language: C#
Platform: .NET Core 2.1

IDE: VS+Resharper or JetBrains Rider or whatever you like

How to set up .NET Core:
Windows: https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows
Linux: https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linux/ubuntu18-04

Branches should follow `<login>/<feature>` format
Commits into master are fine

Code-style
----------
1. Install ReSharper + "StyleCop ReSharper extension" (ReSharper -> Extension Manager -> StyleCop)
2. Use "ReSharper -> Edit -> Cleanup Code" periodically (Ctrl + E, C)
3. Use "ReSharper -> Edit -> Reformat code" (Ctrl + Alt + Entr) regulary
4. Everything that is not touched by "code cleanup" and has no complains from "inspections" is fine
